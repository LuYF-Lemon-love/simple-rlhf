# DeepSpeed Examples
This repository contains various examples including training, inference, compression, benchmarks, and applications that use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed).

## 1. Applications
This folder contains end-to-end applications that use DeepSpeed to train and use cutting-edge models.

## 2. Training
There are several training and finetuning examples so please see the individual folders for specific instructions.

## 3. Inference
The DeepSpeed Huggingface inference [README](./inference/huggingface/README.md) explains how to get started with running DeepSpeed Huggingface inference examples.

## 4. Compression
Model compression examples.

## 5. Benchmarks
All benchmarks that use the DeepSpeed library are maintained in this folder.
